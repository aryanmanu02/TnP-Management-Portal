# 🎓 Training & Placement ERP System

## 📌 Overview

The **Training and Placement ERP System** is a centralized, web-based platform designed to digitize and streamline the end-to-end management of training and campus recruitment activities in educational institutions. Built for seamless interaction between students, coordinators, admins, and optionally recruiters, the system enhances communication, improves transparency, and ensures timely execution of critical T&P tasks.

## ✅ Why This Project?

In most colleges, training and placement processes are still managed manually through spreadsheets, emails, and disconnected tools. This leads to:

- Missed deadlines and announcements
- Lack of a centralized student database
- Inefficient tracking of applications and test results
- Poor communication between students, coordinators, and recruiters

The ERP system eliminates these bottlenecks by providing an **integrated solution** that automates key processes, ensures real-time updates, and maintains structured data for analysis and decision-making.
