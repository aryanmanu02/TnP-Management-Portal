## ✅ Why This Project?

In most colleges, training and placement processes are still managed manually through spreadsheets, emails, and disconnected tools. This leads to:

- Missed deadlines and announcements
- Lack of a centralized student database
- Inefficient tracking of applications and test results
- Poor communication between students, coordinators, and recruiters

The ERP system eliminates these bottlenecks by providing an **integrated solution** that automates key processes, ensures real-time updates, and maintains structured data for analysis and decision-making.
